If You Have an SSH RSA Key (id_rsa.pub or .ssh/authorized_keys):

`ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa.pub`

Understanding the Output:
1024-bit RSA → Weak and deprecated
2048-bit RSA → Common and recommended
3072-bit RSA → More secure
4096-bit RSA → Strong but slower


Extract n Using OpenSSL (Method 1)
Convert the id_rsa.pub file to PEM format and then extract the modulus:

`ssh-keygen -e -m PEM -f id_rsa.pub > rsa_pub.pem`
`openssl rsa -in rsa_pub.pem -pubin -text -noout`

This will display:

Public-Key: (2048 bit)
Modulus:
    00:b3:... (in hex)
Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)
The modulus (n) is the large hex number under "Modulus."
